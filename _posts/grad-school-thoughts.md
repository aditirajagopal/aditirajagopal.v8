“The Great Beauty” opens in Rome, with a split view: one with a group of Japanese tourists sight-seeing, and the other a group of women singing outside a church. One of the Japanese tourists suddently dies at the end of the scene, and we are swiftly launched into the next: an extravagant party for our main character, 65-year-old, “1 hit wonder,” author Jep Gambardella. The abruptness and pace of these first few scenes sets the tone for the rest of the movie. We, along with Jep, float around the ecosystem of characters and events while experiencing a strange contrast – we know, but don’t know, these characters, and we’re engrossed in, but are also numb to the passing events. Jep is the self-proclaimed “king” of society, but it seems like the decadent and sacred parts of his life are mundane. As one auxiliary character mentions, ‘these parties have the best conga lines…they never go anywhere’ – though Jep has this journey to find ‘the great beauty,’ or the inspiration for his second book, the wandering camera along with the wandering characters makes the audience question what is real. 

What gave me pause about this film were the parallels between the lifestyle of Jep and the Darden experience. Our first-year experience had a similar contrast – rather than the sacredness of Rome in contrast with Jep’s extravagant and often vulgar parties, we had the sacredness of our academics in contrast with the extravagance of recruiting events and parties. Like the characters in the movie, we too as students often wander across the student body in search for friendship and comradery – but often we aren’t sure of the depth of those relationships, and whether they will last beyond these two years. Throughout the film, the ultimate question of “Why are we here?” was at the forefront. 

When I think of the question “Why am I here?” my answer is two-fold: why am I here in this moment, and why am I here in the context of my whole story arc. Seeing the film unfold through the lens of a wandering camera made me uncomfortable because I didn’t know what to focus on, and it made me realize that there wasn’t really a story line – for the last two quarters, I have especially felt the same way about my life. Unlike Jep’s numbness to the extravagance and leisure around him, I feel like have become numb to the sheer amount of work I have to do. Like Jep, I feel that time is fleeting, and it’s becoming a lot harder to pin down my answer to the question “Why am I here?” and it’s becoming harder to separate my answer to the question “who am I” from the work I do. 

In watching Jep’s struggles – mostly in the death of other characters, or their critique of his lifestyle – I better recognized my own. As the semester has progressed, I have felt increasingly stressed, and have found several of my peers questioning my lifestyle choices. I have spent a lot of time recently second guessing myself because I don’t feel satisfied with my answers to the ultimate questions and otherwise. Like the disappearing giraffe in the movie, it feels like a trick. My aspiration to be a multilingual leader who can translate between the dialects of business, data science, design, and policy feels like a farce as I struggle in my classes in comparison to my peers. Am I really gaining the skills I desired from this experience – because I barely remember anything. The clarity I had feels it is fading - a story I’m no longer convinced of. Like Jep, will I be an aimless “1 hit wonder”? 

As I write this, I think about the little girl in the movie – the art prodigy – who is pulled away from her friends and forced to create contemporary art live at a party at the behest of her parents. She takes a series of paint pails, charges towards a massive canvas in a rage, and flails her arms to splash paint all over. Though it seems like chaos, moments later, the camera cuts away to reveal a magnificent piece of art. Perhaps this is where I need to be – living in the discomfort and rage about not knowing how to answer the ultimate questions, and throwing thoughts onto the canvas. Who I am, and why I’m here may not be synonymous with the work I do, but perhaps the result might be a force that helps ground me when I’m feeling less than confident with my answers. Perhaps it is enough for now knowing that it is a work in process, and there will be moments, where the camera lets you cut away to see the progress that you have made and the art you have created with your life.
