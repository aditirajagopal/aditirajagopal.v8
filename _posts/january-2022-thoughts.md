## Things I have been playing with 
[Plasmic](plasmic.app) - I decided to give no-code solutions a chance this winter break. I tried out bubble, webflow, and plasmic. Based on my needs (and desire to keep this project under $15/year), I decided to go with plasmic. Pros: Price, Easy interface. Cons: No embed/custom code or css in the interface

## Things that keep me up at night
[An Interview with Kowalski from Nebraska](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNYv--E_zjY) - key takeaways:
- The land use map breakdown at 27:00 was interesting and scary in context of climate change 
- Greenhouses-as-a-service (I kid about the name) should be more of a thing - reduce the reliance on fixed ag hubs, more water & energy efficient, urban farming 2.0 <> community building, and would reduce the stress on supply chains by buying local
-  The Netherlands is one of the largest exporters of agriculture <> because of greenhouses!
